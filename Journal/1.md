### Plan [11:38]
First day, where to begin... I think I will start with languages/stacks I know, this will make it easier to clearly implement the model I have in mind.
Because we are aiming for a lot of disconnected architecture, I shall start with the .net core MVC part with EFcore

### Targets
- [x] Setup .net folder with shared model/repository projects
- [x] Setup mvc folder with mvc routing/rendering project
- [x] Create solution for mvc/efcore
- [ ] Implement

### Report [13:49]
Finished setup and implemented a test scenario for Entity framework

### Thoughts for tomorrow
Try and implement all features in a very basic UI
</br> Dont forget to refresh how to do proper form submitting in MVC core
