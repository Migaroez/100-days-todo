### Plan [11:38]
First day, where to begin... I think I will start with languages/stacks I know, this will make it easier to clearly implement the model I have in mind.
Because we are aiming for a lot of disconnected architecture, I shall start with the .net core MVC part with EFcore

### Targets
[ ] Setup .net folder with shared model/repository projects
[ ] Setup mvc folder with mvc routing/rendering project
[ ] Create solution for mvc/efcore
[ ] Implement

### Report
