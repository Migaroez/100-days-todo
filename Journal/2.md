### Plan [11:58]
Get as far as possible in getting a fully working ui without focusing on the looks to much.

### Targets
- [x] Refresh on MVC form helpers
- [x] Add/Edit/Remove/Mark items
- [x] Add/Edit/Remove Notes

### Report [15:45]
Session was very fractured today, but all goals were met without much effort.
<br/> I like the new razor tag helpers in .net core

### Thoughts for tomorrow
Finish this first project off with some unrendered data, succes/fail messages and validation
