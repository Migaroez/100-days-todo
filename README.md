# 100-days-todo
Trying out as many coding stacks/techniques in 100 days with a simple todo app

# Idea/Why
While traveling and meeting other devs I realized I have been way to comfortable in my own little C# backend bubble (with the ocasional web frontend and wpf). So it is time to start learning again and try out different frameworks/languages. It should also prove the 'ancient' wisdom that a programmer can write in any language as long as he understands the fundamental problem.
Will aim at 1-2 hours a day.

# Scope
### General
The program will be split up into 3 parts with an optional 4th. Presentation, [Communication] , Logic, Storage.
All Communication layers (API) should in essence serve the same output so all detached Presentation layers can process them.
Where possible, each layer should be loosly coupled so they can be reused.

### Out of scope
- Authentication/authorization (user and aplication wide)

### Presentation
Where possible it should be componentized
List of presentation technologies
- [ ] Console! (1)
- [ ] Mvc/html/css (1)
- [ ] Vue2/bootstrap (1)
- [ ] Vue3/bootstrap
- [ ] Vue3/Vuetify/TS
- [ ] WPF (1) (Non MVVM for speed (2))
- [ ] MAUI (With new MVVM framework)
- [ ] Winforms
- [ ] Js/html/css
- [ ] React
- [ ] React Native
- [ ] AngularJs (2) (Maybe, its so old)
- [ ] Angular
- [ ] Native Android

### Communcation
- [ ] C# MVC (1)
- [ ] C# REST Api (as perfect as possible) (1)
- [ ] Nodejs Api
- [ ] Go Api
- [ ] PHP (2)
- [ ] C++ (Native Android)

### Logic
Will be linked to the communcation layer but plans are to use these languages
- [ ] C# (.Net 5)
- [ ] Nodejs
- [ ] Go
- [ ] C++
- [ ] PHP

### Storage
This wil be a mix between plain integrations and using ORMs and not all will be done in every language
- [ ] MSSQL*
- [ ] MYSQL*
- [ ] PostgreSQL
- [ ] NPOCO/PETAPOCO (Have to figure out which one)*
- [ ] Entityframework
- [ ] LocalStorage
- [ ] MongoDb
- [ ] Redis
- [ ] CosmosDB
- [ ] File

_(1) Stacks I already use and are more for completeness/practice
</br>(2) I Shudder at this, but it has to be done_
